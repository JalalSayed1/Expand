# Expand
Expand function to expand shorthand notations like a-z in string into the equivalent complete list eg. abc...xyz. Exercise 3-3 Section 3.5 of The C Programming Language.

## About the project:
- Expand:
  - a-z => abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
  - A-Z => ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
  - 0-9 => 0123456789
  - 9-0 => 9876543210
  - d-a => dcba
  - -a-z => abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz (same as a-z)
  - A-z => ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ (taking first letter's case)
  - a-z0-9 => abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz (same as a-z)

## What did I learn from it:
- Using string.h and ctype.h in C.
- Using functions and parameter/arguments.
- Writing Conditional expressions.
- Increment and Decrement operators.
